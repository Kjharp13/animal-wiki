    <p> The Great White Shark is one of the biggest fish in the sea, and one of the most dangerous. 
        They are easily recognizable by their large, conical snout.
        They can grow to be greater than 20 feet long (usually females) but on average they grow to be anywhere between 11 and 16 feet long and can end up weighing nearly 5000 pounds.
        They can swim at speeds of over 56 km/h (35 mph), and can swim to depths of 1,200 m (3,900 ft). 
        A great white displays countershading, by having a white underside and a grey dorsal area (sometimes in a brown or blue shade) that gives an overall mottled appearance. The coloration makes it difficult for prey to spot the shark because it breaks up the shark's outline when seen from the side and makes it very difficult to be seen from above.
        This particular shark is currently rated as Vulnerable on the endangered animal scale, largely due to their extremely slow reproduction rate.

<h2>TAXONOMY</h2>
    
    <p> Species: Carcharodon Carcharias
        <br>
        Kingdom: Animalia
        <br>
        Phylum: Chordata
        <br>
        Class: Chondrichthyes
        <br>
        Order: Lamniformes
        <br>
        Family: Lamnidae
        <br>
        Genus: Carcharodon 
    </p>
    
<h2>BIOLOGY</h2>
    
    <p> The great white shark has a robust, large, conical snout. 
        The upper and lower lobes on the tail fin are approximately the same size.
        Great white sharks, like many other sharks, have rows of serrated teeth behind the main ones, ready to replace any that break off. When the shark bites, it shakes its head side-to-side, helping the teeth saw off large chunks of flesh.
        Have larger eyes than other shark species in proportion to their body size. The iris of the eye is a deep blue instead of black.
        Females are generally larger than males. Male great whites on average measure 3.4 to 4.0 m (11 to 13 ft) long, while females at 4.6 to 4.9 m (15 to 16 ft).
        Get their name from their large white underbelly, with their top dorsal area it usually grey, but some have been found with brownish and more bluish color, likely an adaptation to their environment in certain places around the world.
    </p>
    
<h2>ECOLOGY</h2>
    
    <p> This great sea beast is found in almost all oceans and sea around the world, really only           staying away from the colder waters in the north and south poles.
        The Great White Shark is one of, if not the largest predator in the ocean. Pretty much at the top of the food chain there is almost nothing this shark will not/cannot eat. 
        Its diet includes: fish (e.g. tuna, rays, other sharks), cetaceans (i.e., dolphins, porpoises, whales), pinnipeds (e.g. seals, fur seals, and sea lions), sea turtles, sea otters (Enhydra lutris), seabirds, and even thing such as metal and wood have been found in the stomachs of sharks, further reinforcing their image as a mindless eating machine.
        It has been found that sight is the sharks most used sense when it comes to hunting but they also have a very good sense of smell, especially for blood in the water.
        One of the Great Whites favorite meals are seals/sea lions
        The only true predator of the Great White in the ocean is the Orca Whale, commonly known as the Killer While. 
    </p>
    
<h2>BEHAVIOR</h2>
    
    <p> The shark’s biology is a big part of its hunting technique as the grey (or brown/blue) top of     their bodies makes it hard for its prey to spot it the further down into the ocean it gets.       The sharks tend to wait deep below the surface and wait for their prey to come about, and         they then launch to the surface and actually grab and carry their prey out of the water for a     few moments.
        Once in the jaws of a great white it will be nearly impossible escape, as it thrashes back and forth using it’s saw like teeth to rip its food to shreds in just a matter of seconds.
        These Eating/Killing machines really serve no other purpose than to eat and eat and keep eating. There is no other real motivation for them which a big part of why they are seen as one of the most dangerous creatures in the sea, if not the most dangerous.
        While they may have a one track mind, do not mistake these animals as mindless. They are actually quite intelligent and use their brain to coordinate their highly-developed hunting senses. For instance, seals and dolphins are quite clever animals but are still often outsmarted by the Great White.
</p>

<h2>RELATIONSHIP WITH HUMANS</h2>
    
    <p>Often seen as a predator of humans, the Great White does not actually actively hunt humans. 
        It is easy to understand humans fear of this big fish though as 1/3 to ½ of all recorded shark  attacks have been at the hands (or fins) of the Great White. 
        Many of these “attacks” have been seen as "test-bites". Great white sharks also test-bite buoys, flotsam, and other unfamiliar objects, and they might grab a human or a surfboard to identify what it is.
        Some also believe that sharks often mistake humans for seals but that is also a misconception, as these attacks usually happen in waters with high visibility and these sharks hunt primarily with their good vision.
        These misconceptions can sometimes lead to something called “shark culling” or “shark control” which is when the government deliberately kills sharks in an attempt to reduce attacks. Fishermen also sometimes target sharks.
        These attacks on sharks, combined with their very slow reproduction rate, are one of the reasons why these sharks find themselves at the vulnerable tier in the endangered scale.
